## Student project concept/idea summary:

The core idea is a garden planning application that allows users to build their garden plot on top of a google maps image of their property.  From here, the typical garden planning features be statically prototyped for the first phase of this project (ie for project submission). Users will be able to build their garden plot on top of an actual image of their property as found on google maps.  The garden plotting will try to be to scale, with measurements adapting to the size of the garden plot.  Within an outlined garden plot, zones can be created, moved or deleted. In a future rendition plants can be moved during the planning phase.  The page will incorporate up to 3 pages.  A main menu, a page for the garden planning phase, and a potential 3rd page based on practical prototyping needs to be decided. 


## Project assignment description:

Mobile is everywhere, and the ability to make mobile applications has never been more sought after or desirable than it is now. Android applications are typically written in Java or Kotlin using Android Studio. iOS applications are written in Swift using XCode (using a Mac).

Other platforms have been created to make it easier to port to multiple platforms. React Native uses JavaScript to create apps that will run on both platforms. Flutter uses the Dart language to achieve the same result.

Getting Started
Official sites:

Android Studio
Develop Apps for iOS
React Native
Flutter
.NET MAUI
Carefully selected information: Informational sites such as Wikipedia often contain great background information about specific technologies or generic principles.

Wikipedia Android Apps
Build Your First Android App
Android Basics in Kotlin
Tutorials: After reading some of the official documentation, consider looking for tutorials on YouTube, Blogs, or Tutorial sites. Here are some search hints.

"Kotlin Tutorial"
"MAUI getting Started"
"Android app tutorial"
"IOS app tutorial"
AI: Asking good questions of AI can also help you learn a language or technology. Be careful and recognize that AI is not always correct.

Unique Module Requirements
Create a Mobile App using one of the following platforms:

Android - Java or Kotlin
iOS - Swift - Note that you need a Mac using XCode for this option
React Native - Javascript - Creates Android/iOS compatible apps
Flutter/Dart - Creates Web/Android/iOS compatible apps
NET MAUI - Creates Cross-platform apps for Android and iOS
The app must demonstrate the following:

All of these basic requirements:

Have at least one screen

Be interactive with the user (e.g. responds to inputs by displaying appropriate outputs)

One of these additional requirements:

Integrate with a component on the phone such as the camera, microphone, sensor, or location services.

Incorporate two or more screens

Store data either in local storage so is persists even if the app closes or if the phone is turned off

Use the Mobile App README.md template.

Guidance
You should consider using Android Studio and either Java or Kotlin (depending on which language you know best). The app should run on an Android phone. If you don't have an Android phone, you can use the emulator provided within Android Studio. Here is a list of websites that you might find useful when creating an Android app:

Project Ideas
Flashcard App: Develop a flashcard app for studying various subjects with user-generated flashcard sets.

Language Learning App: Develop an app for learning new languages, including vocabulary quizzes and pronunciation guides.

News Aggregator: Create an app that aggregates news articles from different sources and displays them to users.

Travel Journal: Build a travel journal app that lets users record their travel experiences with photos and notes.

Drawing and Painting App: Build an app that allows users to draw, paint, and save their artwork.

Online Marketplace: Create a platform for buying and selling items, similar to a classified ads website.

Language Translator: Develop an app that translates text or speech from one language to another.

Event Booking App: Develop an app for booking tickets to concerts, movies, or sporting events.

Health and Fitness App: Create a health and fitness app that offers workout routines, diet tracking, and health statistics.

Travel Planner: Build a travel planning app that helps users organize their trips, including itinerary creation and travel tips.
